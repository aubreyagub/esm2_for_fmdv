# prior to changing should_continue_mutating from checking if sequence probability is increasing to checking if overall mutatioon score is increasing and using the minimum average logit score per position rather than the minimum aa logit value
# experiment observation: constraining positions for mutation increases length of evolution path  
# this is not surprising as mutating the position least favoured by the PLM != mutating the position that will yield an increase in sequence probability 
# replacing the current amino acid at the lowest logit position does not automatically increase the sequence probability 
# this is because it may choose a position where mutations are unlikely to happen at to begin  with (ie highly conserved regions) 
# thus leading to an overall decrease on the sequence probability and structure similarity
# When mutations are contrained to positions we know are highly variable from observed data, this aligns with the PLM's knowledge of existing mutations
# such that mutating these highly variable position can lead to higher probability sequences as it expects mutations to occur in these positions
